# Initial Scope
This beginning project aims to apply SSN predicted temperatures to release/tag locations of wild spring/summer chinook salmon. Based on the area of release, I hope to map certain MPGs or origin histories per fish and then apply temperature as an indice of their early life experience that might influence survival downstream. 


# Data

## Fish
- This data includes any PIT tagged wild spring/summer fish with a release/tag location in the Columbia River Basin.

```{r}
#initial load of data

fish_raw<-read_csv(here("dsynth_2024.20240702.spsu.csv"))

#filter to include Wild and Unknown fish
fish_raw_wild<-fish_raw %>% 
  filter(t_rear_type != "H")
rm(fish_raw)

#check how many unknown
fish_raw_wild %>% 
  group_by(t_rear_type) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())

fish_raw_wild %>% 
  group_by(t_run) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())

# What does the hatchery column refer too?-- MC answered in email--likely based on hatchery assignment near release location
fish_raw_wild %>%
  group_by(t_run) %>%
  summarize(
    total_n_hatchery = sum(!is.na(hatchery)),  # Count rows where hatchery is not empty
    total_n_NA = sum(is.na(hatchery))  # Sum t_run where hatchery is empty
  )
```

Adjusted to use matrix search for juv_first since row_wise() method was so slow. 
```{r matrix search}
# Define the relevant columns
juv_cols <- which(names(fish_raw_wild) == "juv_lgr_first"):
            which(names(fish_raw_wild) == "juv_est_last")

# Convert to matrix for faster processing
juv_matrix <- as.matrix(fish_raw_wild[, juv_cols])

# Find the first non-NA column index for each row
first_non_na_idx <- max.col(!is.na(juv_matrix), ties.method = "first")

# Handle cases where all values are NA
first_non_na_idx[apply(is.na(juv_matrix), 1, all)] <- NA

# Extract the values
fish_raw_wild$juv_first <- ifelse(is.na(first_non_na_idx), NA, 
                                  juv_matrix[cbind(1:nrow(juv_matrix), first_non_na_idx)])

# Extract the location from column names
juv_col_names <- names(fish_raw_wild)[juv_cols]
fish_raw_wild$juv_first_location <- ifelse(is.na(first_non_na_idx), NA, 
                                           sub("juv_([a-z]+)_.*", "\\1", juv_col_names[first_non_na_idx]))

# View results
head(fish_raw_wild)

#adjust to get year and doy then filter 

fish_filtered <- fish_raw_wild %>%
  mutate(
    first_juv_date = as_datetime(first_juv_date, tz = "UTC"),
    juv_year = year(first_juv_date),
    juv_doy = yday(first_juv_date)
  ) %>% 
  filter(between(juv_doy, 70, 160)) %>% 
  filter(is.na(length) | between(length, 50, 155))


# extract adult first and last
fish_filtered <- fish_filtered %>%
  mutate(
    first_adu_date = apply(select(., adu_bon_first:adu_trb_last), 1, function(x) na.omit(x)[1]),
    first_adu_date = as_datetime(first_adu_date, tz = "UTC"), 
    adu_year = year(first_adu_date),
    adu_doy = yday(first_adu_date)
  )

# check arrival dates & length
hist(fish_filtered$juv_doy)
hist(fish_filtered$length)
#' have not filtered transportation type or if no detection as juv or doy
#' How to use mort date, site, age? Seems to know which fish died-- any point in using outside CJS model?
#' What does total RKM mean? how is it calculated-- from where to where?

## SSN temperature
- Attempted a few methods from the website. Possibly the easiest would be to download the whole geodatabase into QGIS and then select the attributes of interest from there and then use that file for the analysis. Provides a bit more flexibility but option 3 is the easiest in Rstudio for mapping where pred temps and fish match up. 


This option was downloading from url: https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST/temperature-models-rscript-ssn.html 
which seems to have observed data but doesn't have predicted data -- has column STREAM_AUG with all -999. Is the file to run for model prediction? Can use with import option 3 for added observation sites to predicted through 2015 map pulled from website. 
```{r import_option_1}

# Load the stream network (edges)
edges_data <- st_read(here("Clearwater.ssn/edges.shp"))
pred_data<- st_read(here("Clearwater.ssn/preds.shp")) #there is no prediction temp (all = -999)-- does this need to be run?
obs_data <- st_read(here("Clearwater.ssn/sites.shp"))

# Check available columns
colnames(edges_data)
colnames(pred_data)


# Plot prediction points on stream network
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = edges_data, color = "lightblue", size = 0.3) +  # Stream network
  geom_sf(data = obs_data, aes(color = STREAM_AUG), size = 1) +  # Observation points
  # geom_sf(data = pred_data, aes(color = STREAM_AUG), size = 1) +  # Prediction points
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "magma", name = "Predicted Temp (°C)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~SAMPLEYEAR) +
  labs(title = "Stream Temperature at Observation sites (1993:2011)",
       subtitle = "Clearwater Basin (NorWeST)")

```

Can get prediction data from NorWeST Stream Temperature Maps _ this works and is flexible in region selected-- gives predicted, observed, and future scenarios.
```{r import_option_2}
#output
mean_aug<-st_read(here("appoutput/Mean_August_Stream_Temperature_(S1__1993-2011).shp"))
obs_pts<- st_read(here("appoutput/Observed_Temperature_Points.shp"))

# Check available columns
colnames(mean_aug)
colnames(obs_pts)


points_sf <- st_cast(mean_aug, "POINT")

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = mean_aug, aes(color = S1_93_11)) +  # Plot lines
  geom_sf(data = obs_pts, color = "black", size = .5) +  # Plot points
    scale_color_viridis_c(option = "magma", name = "Predicted Temp (°C)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
This option works for predicted in stream lines or points. Not sure if it includes observed data points-- not clear. Can download by HUC and use observation data from different files if needed.
downloaded from url : https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST/ModeledStreamTemperatureScenarioMaps.shtml

Need to look into scenarios and how to use them. Seem to have S1: 93-11 and S2: 02-11, then S3:S21 are single years from 1993 to 2011, then there are some future scenarios and predse and then more predictions for additinal years S33:S36- 2012-2015. Doesn't look like those are included in any of the scenario predicted temps across years (S1 and S2). 
```{r import_option_3}
pred_lines<-st_read(here("NorWeST_PredictedStreamTempLines_Clearwater/NorWeST_PredictedStreamTempLines_Clearwater.shp"))
st_crs(pred_lines)
glimpse(pred_lines)
pred_points<-st_read(here("NorWeST_PredictedStreamTempPoints_Clearwater/NorWeST_PredictedStreamTempPoints_Clearwater.shp"))
# st_crs(pred_points)
colnames(pred_lines)
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = pred_lines, aes(color = S2_02_11)) +  
    scale_color_viridis_c(option = "magma", name = "Predicted Temp (°C)") +
  geom_sf(data = obs_pts, color = "forestgreen", size = .5) +  # Plot points from option 1 observation points
  # geom_sf(data = pred_points, size = .5) + 
  theme_minimal()



```


# Fish x SSN
Looking at possible ways to combine fish and temperature 
- get rel_time - tag-time = time spent @ location to be exposed to temperatures
- get rel_time - arrival to LGR = time spent in river to be exposed to temperatures from Release site to LGR
-get a lat/log for release sites
